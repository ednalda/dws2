    <p><a href="http://www.allankardec.com/Allan_Kardec/Le_livre_des_esprits/lesp_us.pdf">The Spirits' Book</a><b> (Le Livre des Esprits in original French)</b> - is part of the Spiritist Codification, and is regarded as one of the five fundamental works of Spiritism. It was published by the French educator Allan Kardec on April 18, 1857. It was the first and remains the most important spiritist book, because it addresses in first hand all questions developed subsequently by Allan Kardec. <br />
    The book is structured as a collection of questions regarding the origin of the spirits, the purpose of the life, the order of the universe, evil and good and the afterlife. Its answers, according to Kardec, were given to him by a group of spirits who identified themselves as "The Spirit of Truth", with whom he communicated in several Spiritist sessions during the 1850s. Kardec, who considered himself an "organizer" rather than an author, grouped the questions and their answers by theme, occasionally including lengthier digressions the spirits had dictated to him on specific subjects, some signed by philosophers such as Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas and writers including <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire">Voltaire.</a>
    </p>

    <h4>Contents</h4>
    <p><b>The Spirits Book is divided into four parts or "books"</b>, each one split into several chapters. Chapters are not regularly subdivided into sections — though most have titles marking the beginning of particularly sought subjects. Book 3's chapters, for some reason, are not numbered.<br />
    <b>Book One</b> (untitled) -  deals with the origins of the universe and the attributes of God.<br />
    Chapter 1 (God) - is intended to clarify the true essence of God.<br />
    Chapter 2 (General Elements of the Universe) - explains the difference between spiritual and material matter and why spirits are not believed by materialists.<br />
    Chapter 3 (Vital Principle) - is about the differences between animate and inanimate beings, between the living and the dead and the features of intelligence compared to instinct.<br />
    <b>Book Two</b> (The Spirit-World) - describes spiritual life.<br />
    Chapter 1 (Spirits) - explains what spirits are, where they come from, what they are like, how they manifest, the purpose of their existence, and how people perceive them.<br />
    Chapter 2 (Incarnation of Spirits) - is about why spirits incarnate in material bodies.<br />
    Chapter 3 (Return from Corporeal Life to Spirit Life) -  is about disincarnation (the death of the Physical Body).<br />
    Chapter 4 (Plurality of Existences) - is about reincarnation.<br />
    Chapter 5 (Considerations on the Plurality of Existences) - is an essay by Kardec meant to clarify the doctrine of the previous chapter.<br />
    Chapter 6 (Spirit Life) - describes what exists in the afterlife, the spiritual world.<br />
    Chapter 7 (Return to Corporeal Life) -  explains how and when spirits come back to life by literally being born again.<br />
    Chapter 8 (Emancipation of the Soul) - is about situations in which the spirit of a living person may be free to interact with the spirits of the dead, as in near-death experiences or during a deep sleep. This chapter does not cover conscious mediumship.<br />
    Chapter 9 (Intervention of Spirits in the Material World) - is about situations in which the spirits of the dead may, ostensibly or not, intentionally or not, have any form of influence on events of the living world.<br />
    Chapter 10 (Occupations and Missions of the Spirits) - is an essay by Kardec on the different reasons why high spirits interfere with the world.<br />
    Chapter 11 (The Three Reigns) -  is about the differences between inanimate beings (mineral), plants, and animals and contains the standard Spiritist Doctrine on Metempsychosis.<br />
    <b>Book Three</b> (Moral Laws) - contains what Kardec regarded as the kernel of his doctrine, the special and fair (in his view) moral laws that provided explanations and consoled people in moments of anger or grief. <br /><br /></p>
    Such laws were actually the following:<br />
    <ul>
     <li>Divine Law</li>
     <li>The Law of Adoration</li>
     <li>The Law of Labour</li>
     <li>The Law of Reproduction</li>
     <li>The Law of Preservation</li>
     <li>The Law of Destruction</li>
     <li>Social Law</li>
     <li>The Law of Progress</li>
     <li>The Law of Equality</li>
     <li>The Law of Liberty</li>
     <li>The Law of Justice, Love and Charity</li>
     <li>Moral Perfection</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Book Four</b> (Hopes and Consolations) - is about the most common doubts people have about religion in general and tries to solve the most sensitive ones under new light.<br />
    Chapter 1 (Earthly Joys and Sorrows) - is about the meaning of the experiences we have on Earth, both good and bad.<br />
    Chapter 2 (Future Joys and Sorrows) - is about the laws governing the future lives we are bound to live after we die.</p>
    <h4>Basic Concepts</h4>
   <p>Some aspects of the doctrine contained in the book:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Man is a Spirit with a material body, i.e. our truer selves are not material, but spiritual.</li>
        <li>A living person is made of three entities: the spirit, the body and the spiritual body (the perispirit) that binds both. The perispirit is an original word of Spiritism.</li>
        <li>Spirits pre-exist and will survive matter that was created.</li>
        <li>There are not angels or demons as separate orders in the creation, but only good and evil spirits. Even a beastly person will eventually attain perfection.</li>
        <li>All Spirits are created simple and ignorant. They gradually evolve intellectually and morally, so passing from an inferior order to more elevated ones until finally reaching perfection.</li>
        <li>All Spirits preserve their individuality, before, during and after each life (incarnation). However, the amount of memory one retains depends on one's level of spiritual progression.</li>
        <li>The different corporeal existences of the Spirit are progressive and not regressive. The pace of their progress, however, depends on the effort made towards betterment. Spirits can stagnate for so long that it seems to be an eternity and it can even appear that they have retrograded.</li>
        <li>Spirits pertain to various orders, according to the degree of perfection they have attained, in three major categories (with fluid limits and unknown number of subcategories): Pure Spirits, who have attained maximum perfection; Good Spirits, whose desire towards goodness predominates, and Imperfect Spirits, who are characterized by ignorance and evil impulses. The relationship of Spirits with Man is constant and has always existed. The Good Spirits do their best to lead us towards goodness and uphold us during our trials, helping us to support them with courage and resignation. By contrast, the Imperfect Spirits try to incite us toward evil.</li>
        <li>Everyone has their own spirit-protector, otherwise known as a guardian angel, who is entrusted with keeping watch over somebody as a mission or trial for them. Similarly to our incarnation on the earth, this mission for them can be a way of advancing and purifying themselves.</li>
        <li>Jesus is the guide and model for mankind. The Doctrine which he taught and exemplified is the most pure expression of God's Laws. However, most of the traditional doctrine on him being the Christ (Messiah) is seen under a different light. Aspects regarded as keystones of faith by most denominations, like trinitarianism and the virgin birth are not seen as important, while his resurrection is explained in another way. His death also has a different interpretation: instead of a sacrifice to atone for our sins, it is an example of the importance of being coherent and resisting temptation.</li>
        <li>Man has free will, but must face the consequences of his deeds.</li>
        <li>The future life is in accordance to one's behavior and learning needs.</li>

    <h2 id="About The Author">About The Author</h2>
    <p> Allan Kardec is the pen name of the French teacher and educator Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail (Lyon, October 3, 1804 – Paris, March 31, 1869). He is known today as the systematizer of Spiritism for which he laid the foundation with the five books of the Spiritist Codification.
    </p>
    <hgroup>
    <h4>Early Life</h4>
    <p>Rivail was born in Lyon in 1804. He was raised as a Catholic.He was a disciple and collaborator of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, and a teacher of mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, physiology, comparative anatomy and French in Paris. For one of his research papers, he was inducted in 1831 into the Royal Academy of Arras.[2] He organized and taught free courses for the underprivileged.
    On February 1832, he married Amélie Gabrielle Boudet. Rivail became a convert to Spiritism in May, 1855 after attending a séance where he claimed to witness table-turning which he believed was caused by spirits.
    </p>
    <h4>Spirit Interest</h4>
    <p>He was already in his early 50s when he became interested in the wildly popular phenomenon of spirit-tapping. At the time, strange phenomena attributed to the action of spirits were reported in many different places, most notably in the U.S. and France, attracting the attention of high society. The first such phenomena were at best frivolous and entertaining, featuring objects that moved or "tapped" under what was said to be spirit control. In some cases, this was alleged to be a type of communication: the supposed spirits answered questions by controlling the movements of objects so as to pick out letters to form words, or simply indicate "yes" or "no". <br />
    Allan Kardec and his wife Amélie Gabrielle Boudet
    At the time, Franz Mesmer's theory of animal magnetism was popular in the upper reaches of society. When confronted with the phenomena described, some researchers, including Rivail, pointed out that animal magnetism might explain them.Rivail, however, after personally seeing a demonstration, quickly dismissed the animal-magnetism hypothesis as being insufficient to completely explain all the facts observed and supported the spirit hypothesis (see Chapters VIII and XIV in The Book on Mediums).
    </p>
    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>As a teacher with little scientific background (he had never attended a university), Rivail decided to do his own research. Not being a medium himself, he compiled a list of questions and began working with mediums and channelers to put them to spirits. Soon the quality of the communications, allegedly with spirits, appeared to improve.
    Rivail used the name "Allan Kardec" allegedly after a spirit identified as Zefiro, whom he had been communicating with, told him about a previous incarnation of his as a Druid by that name. Rivail liked the name and decided to use it to keep his Spiritist writings separate from his work, basically books for high school students. Rivail believed in reincarnation which was in opposition to American and British Spiritualism.<br />
    On April 18, 1857, Rivail (signing himself "Allan Kardec") published his first book on Spiritism, The Spirits' Book, comprising a series of answered questions (502 on first edition and 1,019 numbered in next editions)[n 1] exploring matters concerning the nature of spirits, the spirit world, and the relations between the spirit world and the material world. This was followed by a series of other books, like The Book on Mediums and The Gospel According to Spiritism, and by a periodical, the Revue Spirite, which Kardec published until his death. Kardec thus produced the books that form the Spiritist Codification.
    </p>
    <h4>Memorial</h4>
    <p>After his death caused by aneurysm, Kardec was buried at the Cimetière du Père Lachaise.

<h2 id="Spiritualism versus Spiritism">Spiritualism or Spiritism</h2>
<h4>Spiritualism</h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism">Spiritualism</a> is a <a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/religiondefinition/a/definition.htm">religion</a> postulating the belief that spirits of the dead residing in the spirit world have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living.Spiritualism developed and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s, especially in English-speaking countries. By 1897, it was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe, mostly drawn from the middle and upper classes.
The religion flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization, attaining cohesion through periodicals, tours by trance lecturers, camp meetings, and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums. Many prominent Spiritualists were women, and like most Spiritualists, supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage. By the late 1880s the credibility of the informal movement had weakened due to accusations of fraud being perpetrated by mediums, and formal Spiritualist organizations began to appear. Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational Spiritualist churches in the United States, Canada and United Kingdom. </p> 
<h4>Spiritism</h4>
<p class="one"><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14221a.htm">Spiritism<a/>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine">doctrine</a> developed by Allan Kardec and today found mostly in continental Europe and Latin America, especially Brazil, has emphazised reincarnation.
